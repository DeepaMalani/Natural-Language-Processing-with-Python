- Used UCI SMS Spam collection DataSet to build a spam detection filter with python.

- This dataset contains more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages labeled as spam or ham.
 
- Used NLTK library and sklearn library to convert the raw messages (sequence of characters) into vectors (sequences of numbers) 
 because the classification algorithm works with numerical feature vector in order to perform the classification task
 
- Used Naive Bayes classifier algorithm to train spam/ham classifier.
